# my_husky_package

This ROS package is used for navigating a Husky robot using GPS data and an extended kalman filter. It has an action server for user input to the ROS system, algorithms for creating paths, ways of simulating the system and a relay node system for maintaining localization accuracy with a temporary loss of GPS data.

For more comprehensive information on the use-cases and the system, please refer to the README.md file in each of the directories.
